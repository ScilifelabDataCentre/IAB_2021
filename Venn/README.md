## To produce the Venn diagram plots

- Requirements.txt lists the packages required to produce the venn diagrams 

- Venn2biblio_script.py was used to produce the final plot. There are instuctions in the comments on this script that detail how to use it. 

- venn3_script.py and manualinsertvalues.py are both draft scripts that may be useful in future. the first shows how a '3 bubble' plot may be produced. The latter shows how to produce plots with values manually inserted.
