## How to use PPtop10/PPtop1 scripts

PPtop10_PPtop1_overyears.py: generates plots for PPtop10 and PPtop1 for all years covered in the JIF plots.

PPtop10_overyears_1518.py: generates plots for PPtop10 and PPtop1 for all years 2015-2018, consistent with Leiden rankings. This script was ultimately used for the report. However, only plots for PP(top10) were used as these are more generally comparable to bibliometrics done elsewhere.
