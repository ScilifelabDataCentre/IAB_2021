## Information regarding these scripts

These scripts were not used to generate any plots for the IAB report. However, they may be useful in future years. These plots allow a third variable to be assigned as the colour on a bar chart. Draft scripts are available for both categorical and continuous variables. Notes are available on the script for guidance.
